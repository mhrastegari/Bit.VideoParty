# Bit Video Party!

**Watch a group movie with the help of VLC and Bit!**

1. Download and run the program from the [Releases page](https://github.com/ysmoradi/Bit.VideoParty/releases/tag/v-1.0.0)
2. Enter a shared group name that you choose beforehand and connect.
3. Everyone in the VLC program opens the desired video and goes to the beginning of the movie or any agreed-upon time by the rest of the group members.

***Given that the file is locally streamed, a strong internet connection is not necessary.***

5. Start a group call on Skype or Google Meet etc. and if desired, share your webcam screen! (Optional)
6. Whenever anyone wants to stop the video for the whole group or continue playback, they just need to press the Toggle button so it happens for her and the rest of the group!

Press `Toggle` button and enjoy! (";
